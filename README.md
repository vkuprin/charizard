    - The pokémon type
    - its abilities
    - Few moves it can learn
    - Its statistics
- You can use either the [REST](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) or [GraphQL](https://pokeapi.co/docs/graphql) API
- Few ideas to implement
    - Error handling
    - Type safety
    - State management and/or caching
    - Pagination
    - Search

**Delivery**

- Once you are done with the implementation. You should share a private github repo with your code with the following accounts : `adibbaziz`, `p-j`, `mouhcine-clone`
- We should be able to run your code by executing the following steps :
    - `git clone <you-repo-url>`
    - `npm install` (or `yarn/pnpm` equivalent)
    - `npm start` (or `yarn/pnpm` equivalent)
